/*
 * Code by: Sarah Faust
 * 
 * This class filters the given dataset to only include batteries with a definitive pass/fail status.
 * These batteries and the patterns of their test results will be used to set the standard as to whether other batteries
 * 		will pass or not based on how their test results compare.
 * 
 * The output will have:
 * 	A) The first 3 test periods of batteries with a battery_status of 1
 * 	B) The first 3 test periods of batteries with a battery_status of 2
 * 	C) The first 3 test periods of batteries with a battery_status of 3 AND feature a test_period of 9 or higher
 * 
 * Note that entire rows are outputted, not just specific columns.
